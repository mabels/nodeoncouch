With the first complete relaease today all tests are working. 
And my real life samples are also working.
You could run this in every existing couchserver version from 1.0x and up its you
risk, i will try to fix any problems if you report them.
If you want to run the test you need my fork of the couchdb source tree until 
couchbase integrated my work into the mainstream git.
After a longer discussion with jchris I changed list function from a syncron interface 
to a async one.
The old api looks like that:
function() {
	send....
	while(row = getRow()) {
		send....
	}
	send...
	return "tail";
}
the new looks like this. The old API call getRow does not exists anymore. But in 
the spidermonkey implementation it is still there and is working.

function() {
	on('head', function() { 
		send ....
	})
	on('row', function(row) {
		send ....
		stop(obj); // this stops the read of rows 
	})
	on('tail', function() {
		send ....
		return "trailvalue";
	})
}

To deploy you just need to link the couchjs over the orignal one.

ln -nfs <PATHTOTHISCOUCHJS> couchjs

I will make next a npm module

Have fun!
